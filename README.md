# Lab: Linked List Nodes with Weak Pointers

This C++ project demonstrates the usage of smart pointers, specifically `shared_ptr` and `weak_ptr`, to manage a linked list.

## Features

- Implementation of a singly linked list using `shared_ptr` for node management.
- Use of `weak_ptr` to access nodes in a non-owning manner.
- Demonstration of automatic memory management and the effect of `weak_ptr` on `shared_ptr` reference counts.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later, as it makes use of modern C++ features such as smart pointers.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linked-list-weak-ptrs.git
cd linked-list-weak-ptrs
